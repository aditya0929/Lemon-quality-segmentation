**SOCIAL SUMMER OF CODE 2023**

**The models that i have created are based on the approach for making a Deep Learning Model which deals with mutli isntance image classification as in the dataset provided we had three classes of images:-**
1. bad_quality 
2. empty_background 
3. good_quality 

## Important note:-
**for all the three models that i have created, the parts excluding the model architecture and its definition are mostly the same for the accuracy result to be based out on the same parameters.**
